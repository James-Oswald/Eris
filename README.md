# Eris
A game in Java made on a custom 3D game engine. Made with LWJGL, OpenGL, glfw, and JOML.
This Project was made back in 2017 as my final project for my AP Java class. 
Unfortunately, I lost the compile script for it long long ago however I have included all of the
.class files as the were and testing it years later in 2020, It still works if you run it using Java 8.

In order to actually run it, on windows you can use the start.bat file which just contains the line:
```bat
java -cp lib/*; -Djava.library.path=native/; TitleScreen
```

I haven't actually tried to run on anything else besides Windows, but i'm fairly certain that since I've only tested it with dlls in the native folder it probably won't run on anything else, however all of the core libraries used in this project also have their respective .so files in there since im pretty sure I was originally planning on making this cross platform.
