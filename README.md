# Eris
A game in Java made on a custom 3D game engine. Made with LWJGL and OpenGL.
This Project was made back in 2017 as my final project for my AP Java class. 
Unfortunately, I lost the compile script for it long long ago however I have included all of the
.class files as the were and testing it years later in 2020, It still works if you run it using a Java 8.

In order to actually run it, on windows you can use the start.bat file which just contains the line
`java -cp lib/*; -Djava.library.path=native/; TitleScreen`
which is what you should run if you're trying to run this on anything else.
